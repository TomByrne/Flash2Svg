### Installation issues ###
If you've installed the plugin but it isn't showing up, it could be a number of issues related to the Adobe plugin installation system.
[Check here for manual installation process.](docs/manual-install.md)

## To build the extension on Windows ##
- Download the [CS6 Signing Toolkit](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/creativesuite/sdk/eula_cs6-signing-toolkit.html)
- Download the [CC Signing toolkit](http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/extensionbuilder3.html)
- Put the contents of both archives into the `build/tools` folder
- Create a p12 certificate and save it to `build/cert.p12`
- Open the `password.txt` file and save the certificate's password in the file (this will be ignored by GIT).
- Create `bin` folder in the root directory to receive the output
- Run the `build/build.bat` file

To build on other operating systems, the build.bat file will have to be converted, if you do this send me a pull request and I'll add your script into the main repo.

## Added features ##
Some features are not in flash but are added to improve the output, they're all optional.

### High FPS ###
This allows tween animations to play at whatever framerate the browser chooses (normally 60 fps). It makes animations look much smoother than their SWF counterpart.

### Animated View Box ###
If you have a scene which you'd like to pan and zoom around during the animation, you can add a rectangular symbol and name it "viewBox" (with exactly that capitalisation) and animate it around your scene. When the animation is exported, this area will be considered the 'camera' and will animate the visible area of the scene during playback.
